% HO 6/25/2010 flipped the division to calculate Round.Long, Round.Oblong
% and Round.Compact so that less spherical or less smooth ugly dots get
% lower values, then you can set threshold to take higher values in anaSG.
% However, Compact doesn't work well with small dots which have only
% several voxels because if you think 7-voxel sphere, 1 in the center and 6
% around the center voxel, the average 6-connectivity face per voxel will
% be ~4.3, but if you think 2by2by2 square (8 voxels in total), the value
% will be 3, much lower than sphere. So, actually lots of small dots whose
% Compact values come out large with my flipping the division are noise, so
% the thresholding in anaSG using Compact wouldn't work. This is why the
% old definition somehow worked fine. Just don't include this criteria for
% minimum thresholding in anaSG.
% HO 7/6/2010 modified the generation of reference sphere. Since I use
% different xyz voxel dimentions for different types of imagings, I had to
% increase the volume of reference sphere to work with finer images. Then,
% the old code took forever to generate it, so I modified the code to make
% it faster.
